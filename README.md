Predicting Electric Vehicle sales in Indian states using ML and data analysis.
# 🔋 Electric Vehicle Sales Prediction in India using Linear Regression

This project analyzes Electric Vehicle (EV) sales across Indian states and uses a machine learning model (Linear Regression) to predict future EV sales based on historical data.

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains:
- **State**
- **Year**
- **EV Type** (e.g., 2-Wheeler, 4-Wheeler)
- **Sales** (Target Variable)

📄 *Dataset is stored as `ev_sales_india.csv`.*

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
To build a **supervised regression model** that predicts EV sales based on state, year, and vehicle type.

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression)

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- State-wise sales distribution
- EV type-wise trends
- Year-wise growth
- Actual vs Predicted comparison
